# Patika Clone

## Instructor Panel

When instructors log into the system, they should be presented with a screen where they can perform their tasks.

Instructors can view and list the assigned trainings given to them by the operators. They do not have the authority to edit or delete the trainings. They cannot see trainings assigned to other instructors.

The task of instructors is to add content to the trainings (similar to the Java 102 Course on the patika.dev website).

Instructors can add content, edit their own content, delete their own content, and list their own content.

Properties of the content:

- Content Title
- Content Description
- Content YouTube Link
- Content Quiz Questions
- Information about the related course of the content

Quiz questions will be added from the instructor panel, and while adding a question, the instructor should select the corresponding content.

On the content listing screen, filtering should be available based on courses and content titles.

Instructors should be able to perform all these tasks through the interface.

## Student Panel

When students log into the system, similar to what you have done, they should be able to access courses through learning paths.

Students can list the learning paths available in the system.

Students should be able to register for a course through learning paths.

Students can access and view the content related to the course they have registered for (embedding the YouTube video within the project is not necessary, providing a link is sufficient).

Students can evaluate and comment on the content of the courses.

Students can solve quizzes related to the courses.

Students should be able to perform all these tasks through the interface.

## Operator Panel Additions

Operators have the authority to delete and edit all learning paths, trainings, content, and quizzes in the system.

## Additions to the Login Screen

If students do not have an account during the login process, they should be able to register for the system.

A registration screen should be designed, and only students should be able to register for the system.

The developers (i.e., you) should add the operators to the system, and only operators should be able to add instructors.
